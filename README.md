# Kernigan-Ritchie-C-Exercises

This is my collection of solutions to Kernighan and Ritchie's The C Programing Language, 2nd edition (1988).  I am 
posting these codes for anyone's use and everyone's constructive criticism.

Most of these can be used by simply compiling the source and 'cat'ing the input into the executable via a pipe:

cat testfile | '<executable>'

Those solutions that do not function by operating on a character stream through stdin can either be run as stand-alone 
executables, or contain addiontional instructions in their headers.
